# Introduction

Welcome to the GetSocial API! You can use it to access GetSocial API endpoints, which provide data access to sharing statistics of news articles in public social networks & private messaging apps.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: 4580df25599d5baf7fdd"
```

> Make sure to replace `4580df25599d5baf7fdd` with your API key.

GetSocial uses API keys to allow access to the API. <%# You can register a new GetSocial API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers). %>

GetSocial expects that an API key is included in all server requests, in a header as follows:

`Authorization: 4580df25599d5baf7fdd`

You must replace <code>4580df25599d5baf7fdd</code> with your personal API key.
