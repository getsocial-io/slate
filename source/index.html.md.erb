# Introduction

Welcome to the GetSocial API! You can use it to access GetSocial API endpoints, which provide data access to sharing statistics of news articles in public social networks & private messaging apps.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: abcdef0123abcdef0123"
```

> Make sure to replace `abcdef0123abcdef0123` with your API key.

GetSocial uses API keys to allow access to the API. <%# You can register a new GetSocial API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers). %>

GetSocial expects that an API key is included in all server requests, in a header as follows:

`Authorization: abcdef0123abcdef0123`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>abcdef0123abcdef0123</code> with your personal API key.
